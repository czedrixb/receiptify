# Receiptify

This project is a simplified clone of Receiptify that only displays the top 5 tracks for the current month. It is limited to specific users Iâ€™ve added to the user management of my Spotify dashboard, as the app is in development mode ðŸ˜”. Built to experiment with Nuxt.js and Node.js, the OAuth authentication is handled by the Node.js backend, while the Nuxt.js frontend handles data fetching and presentation.
